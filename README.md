## hi

we're [Mikey](https://dinosaur.is) and [Ben](http://www.bennolan.com/)

we've done a few LED things before, learned some beeps and boops that we want to share!

## what to expect from this workshop

this workshop is a whirlwind introduction to the concepts and practices to get started with off-grid art using programmable LEDs.

in our short time together, we hope to provide useful breadcrumbs to help you navigate the trails ahead:

- an overview of the landscape
- what things in this world are called
- how to get started on your journey
- what to look out for as you go
- some tips and tricks for your practice

???

## outline

1. programmable LEDs, what are they?
2. how do you control them? (arduino and basic programming)
3. how do you connect to/from them? (soldering strips, JST plugs)
4. how do you power them? (buck converters + 12v batteries or 18650s or AAs)
5. how do you diffuse them?

with a bonus round of 'how to order the good shit from AliExpress'.

## what are programmable LEDs?

we're going to be playing with WS2018B or [APA102C](https://www.pololu.com/product/2552) (or [SK9822](https://www.pololu.com/product/3086)) LEDS.

- each pixel is individually addressable (can be an independent color)
- you talk to the LEDs over wire(s) using a protocol called [SPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Peripheral_Interface)
- powered at 5V (or lower voltages such as 3.3V is acceptable)

???

most common form is as a strip

---

### other types of electro-magic lights

- single (high-power) LED
- 12v single-color LED strips
- El-Wire
- El-Tape
- El-Panel
- and more

---

## how do you control the LEDs?

to control your heap of LEDs, you will use a micro-controller (a small computer) to send messages over a wire to the first LED, who will relay extra messages to the next LED, and so on.

???

(you don't need to know this)

### [SPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Peripheral_Interface) (Serial Peripheral Interface)

reference: https://www.pololu.com/product/2552

---

### micro-controller

we will be using the popular Ardunio flavor of micro-controllers.

- [Arduino Uno](https://store.arduino.cc/usa/arduino-uno-rev3)
  - <img width="100" src="./images/a000066_front_1_1_1.jpg" />
- [Teensy](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/index.html)
  - <img width="100" src="./images/teensy32.jpg" />
- [Adafruit Feather](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-feather)
  - <img width="100" src="./images/3857-01.jpg" />

---

### [FastLED](http://fastled.io/)

we will use a library _FastLED_ to help us code the LEDs.

```
#include <FastLED.h>

#define NUM_LEDS 60
#define DATA_PIN 6

CRGB leds[NUM_LEDS];

void setup () { 
  FastLED.addLeds<APA102>(leds, NUM_LEDS);
}

void loop () {
  leds[0] = CRGB::Red; 
  FastLED.show(); 
  delay(30); 
}
```

---

### [HSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV)

compare to RGB color space

<img width="400" src="./images/HSV_color_solid_cylinder_saturation_gray.png" />

---

### [Noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlin_noise)

noise functions generate random numbers with smooth steps

<img width="400" src="./images/tumblr_otdt2ybH5m1qdxg1vo1_500.gif" />

---

### adding physical interfaces

- buttons
- rotary encoders
- accelerometer
- magnetometer
- gryoscope
- temperature gauge

e.g. [Teensy Prop Shield](https://nicegear.nz/product/teensy-prop-shield)

---

### more dimensions

```
set_color(x, y, color)
```

```
set_color(x, y, z, color)
```


---

### examples

- single: rainbow fade
- strip: rainbow scroll
- strip: rainbow chase
- grid: explosion

---

## how to connect to/from the LEDs?

we will need a way to connect from the controller to the LEDs,

and from each chain of LEDs to the next chain.

---

### 4-pin jst connectors

- pre-installed on LED strips by default
- useful wire-to-wire connector
- not waterproof

---

### 4-pin header connectors

https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0777BQC1P/

- useful wire-to-wire and board-to-wire connector
- not waterproof

---

### 4-pin waterproof connectors

---

### soldering tips

---

## how to power the leds?

we will need a way to power the LEDs, they are very bright!

---

### power usage

each LED uses up to 60mA when white at full brightness.

in practical use, when not using white, we use 20mA as a rule of thumb, with lower brightnesses even lower.

```
60 pixels ร 20 mA รท 1,000 = 1.2 Amps minimum
```

### power injection

<img src="./images/leds_brownout.jpg" />

<img src="./images/leds_nobrown.jpg" />

---

### reducing power use

- each pixel is actually 3 LEDs: red + green + blue
  - displaying red only uses 1/3 the power
  - displaying purple (red + blue) uses 2/3 the power
  - displaying white uses 3/3 the power
- not every pixel must be on at all times!

???

reference: https://learn.adafruit.com/sipping-power-with-neopixels

---

### using many power supplies

if you need to use many power supplies:

- each power supply's GROUND is connected in common
- each power supply's +5V is connected to **one** length of pixels

???

each power supply has slightly different +5V, if they are connected they will back-feed into each other and very bad things may happen.

---

### 5v power supply

---

### batteries

---

### 12v battery + dc step-down (buck) converter

---

### 18650 batteries

---

### aa batteries

### how does a diffuser work?

<a href="http://close-uppity.derekhauffe.net/diffusion/">
  <img src="./images/figure_1-01.jpg" />
</a>

???

- must have some distance between light source and diffuser

---

### what are good diffusers?

- good: dish foam (for packing your dishes in boxes)
- good: bubble wrap
- okay: baking paper
- ???

---
class: center

## how do you get started?

---

### what parts do we need?

there are 3 major parts to the system:

1. LEDs
1. controller
1. power source

---

### beginner parts

- LEDs: start with LED strips
  - [Adafruit Neopixel](http://www.adafruit.com/category/168) / [AliExpress WS2812]()
  - [Adafruit DotStar](https://www.adafruit.com/category/885) / [AliExpress APA102]()
- LED connector: start with JST connectors
- controller: start with Teensy
  - [NiceGear Teensy LC](https://nicegear.nz/product/teensy-lc)
- power source:
  - if small, use usb power pack
  - if large, use deep cycle battery
